    "-1100": "<p><b>1100 BCE</b> isn't a firm date: by scholarly convention, the Exodus occurred (if at all) about 1200 with Joshua's conquest of Caanan 40 years later.  So, 1100 seems to be a reasonable nominal date for the start of the period of <b>Judges</b>.</p>",
    "-1020": "<p>In <b>1020 BCE</b> (more or less) the monarchy began with the anointment by Samuel of <b>Saul</b> as King (followed by <b>David</b> and <b>Solomon</b>).</p>",
